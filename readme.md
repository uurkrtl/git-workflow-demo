## Coding: Git Workflow

Create a new Git repository in your preferred tool (e.g. IntelliJ).

-   Step 1: Create a new project.
-   Step 2: Publish this project on GitHub.
-   Step 3: Create a new feature branch with a meaningful name.
-   Step 4: Make changes in your feature branch, commit and push them.
-   Step 5: Switch back to the main branch (e.g. 'main' or 'master') and make new changes, commit and push them.
-   Step 6: Locally merge the changes from the main branch into your feature branch.
-   Step 7: Resolve any conflicts during the merge.
-   Step 8: Push your feature branch to GitHub.
-   Step 9: Create a pull request for your feature branch and have your colleagues review it.
-   Step 10: After approval, perform the merge and delete the feature branch.
